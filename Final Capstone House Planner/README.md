# Final Capstone

This is the final project I worked on while at Tech Elevator.<br>

4 of us worked as an agile team to build a house planning app. <br>
Our original goal was to build an app that allowed users to design their dream house through an interactive GUI. The app would save the designs from each user and allow you to make your designs publid or private. A priority for our team was to find a way to calculate the estimated cost of the house you designed based on the location chosen. You could theoretically design the house and change the location to see what the cost could be based on where you want to build. As I learned from this project, building an app from scratch that accomplished these goals is hard work and very time consuming <br>

The interactive GUI was the goal we had to cut because of our time limitations, we only had 8 days to complete this project and many days turned into late nights.

## The app consists of 3 parts of an MVC design.<br>

First is a Database built in PGAdmin using PostgreSQL. You can find the database build files in the database folder.

Second is the Controller built in IntelliJ IDEA using Java. This is the traffic light between the database and the user interface relying heavily on Spring's Jdbc and Rest templates.

Finally is the front end built in vue.js using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We decided to put the API connection to a realestate cost estimator in the front end and learned all about working with asynchronous elements in data retrieval. 

Hope you enjoy:)
